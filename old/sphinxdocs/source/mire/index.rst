Mapping Open Data to the Model Inventory of Roadway Elements
============================================================

.. note::

   From our last conversation, we understood that: 
   
      * data interoperability is essential
      * achieving large-scale coverage of intersection inventory is a priority

With this in mind, our aim is to automatically create as much of an intersection inventory as possible.
We aim for compatibility with MIRE v2.0 through a reusable software library and through API endpoints. 
Elements of the Model Inventory will be collected and transformed from open sources where possible; some
elements require machine learning.

Subsequent parts of this section discuss our immediate plans and progress towards modeling and automating
an intersection inventory.
